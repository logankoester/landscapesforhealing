I am a licensed clinical mental health counselor in New Hampshire, offering counseling services to adult individuals and couples. I also offer group therapy.

My practice is a general mental health practice, addressing a variety of issues and concerns, including:

* transitions – managing growth and change
* loss, grief and bereavement
* anxiety and depression
* relationship difficulties
* family issues
* managing stress
* teaching basic meditation and inner focusing skills
* clarifying one’s sense of life meaning and purpose

Many circumstances can motivate someone to seek a counselor. Counseling can offer refreshing insight, inspiration and joy as we resolve the difficulties that weigh us down.

Most of us have experienced times of feeling discouraged and unsure of what we need in order to feel deeply satisfied and at peace with ourselves. What we strive for may be a greater sense of purpose, and a way to live a more fulfilling life.

These and other reasons often lead people to a counselor or therapist to help them increase their understanding of themselves and to guide them in making effective changes in their lives.
