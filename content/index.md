## Envision...

a special garden to unwind, rejuvinate, clear your thoughts… a place of
peace and healing.

## What is your vision?

Landscapes For Healing brings you professionals with the experience and
expertise to create a garden designed for your specific healing focus.

For many of us it’s refreshing to step outdoors and take a deep breath,
enjoying a moment of relaxation between the varied responsibilities of our
day. Just as nature continually rejuvenates itself, it seems to offer a
place in which we can heal and rejuvenate as well.

A healing garden can offer a natural setting to support us in this process.
Healing gardens can encourage mental, emotional and physical relaxation and
stress-reduction. We can design a place to help you feel safe and refreshed,
a haven and source for renewal.

We will provide the energy and knowledge to give you the design for a garden
oriented to your specific needs.
