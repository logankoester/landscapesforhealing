Lea Hutchins began her work in the field of **psychotherapy** and **personal
growth** in 1978. She opened her first practice in Seattle in 1983. She has a
Masters degree in Psychology and has experience in outpatient mental health
settings, residential treatment facilities, and in private practice. She is a
licensed clinical mental health counselor, currently working in private
practice in the seacoast region of New Hampshire.

Lea brings a **holistic orientation** to her work, which means that she
focuses on the whole person; appreciating and working with all the inner
resources each individual has, their **strengths and potentials** as well as
those areas in which they may be experiencing difficulty.

This perspective enhances her ability to respect and work with each person
based on their particular needs and goals, taking into account their total
well-being. In addition to her psychotherapy training, Lea also has experience
in **meditation**. In all her work, Lea conducts therapy with
**confidentiality**, **respect**, and **appreciation** for each individual.
